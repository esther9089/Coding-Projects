This is a collection of previous projects I have worked on. 

Gomoku.py is an AI engine for the game Gomoku, played between two players. Functions analyze sequences played by the players, detect the optimal move for computer to maximize score, and determines current status of the game.

a1.c is an order management system using C to manage food orders. Functions loads the menu, load orders in correct queue, retrieve orders based on when they were placed, and gets the total cost of the order.

a2.c is a data encryption program that compresses data to a QR code and identifies evidence of data corruption.
